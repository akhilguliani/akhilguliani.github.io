<p>Hi, I am Akhil Guliani, a second year student in the Master of Science in Computer Engineering Program at Northwestern University. This webpage contains a copy of my publications and project reports. I will be expanding this into a proper Bio page later on. A link to my github page and my linkedin page is present on the left.</p>

<p>
The following are links to some of the projects I have done so far:
<ul>
			<li>Implementing Device File Virtualization for Palacios VMM:
				Developed as part of a team a proof of concept for device file virtualization for Palacios Virtual Machine Monitor. The concept allows a Linux guest to access the device files of the Linux host. Our implenattion was pulled into the main repository available publically at this <a href="http://v3vee.org/palacios/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=palacios.git;a=commit;h=de0aa03dbd9812a48cab6d899ab41b7f2cc593b5">link</a>. This project started as part if a course and was developed further during an independent study.</li>
				
			<li><a href="files/sentimentreport.pdf">Determining the Impact of Hashtags used in Marketing Campaigns on Social Media Platforms Using Sentiment Analysis</a> :
			A Data analytics project to study the effect of user sentiments on text surrounding hashtags in social media posts to gauge the public response to a marketing campaign associated with the hashtag. This was developed as part of a Seminar course on Social media minig at Northwestern </li>
			
           <li><a href="files/Internship2.pdf">Study And Implementation Of Real Time Operating Systems For 8-bit Microcontrollers</a> :
			As Part of Internship at IIT Delhi, studied Real Time operating systems (RTOS). Surveyed the possible RTOS options available for a TinyAVR microcontrollers. Chose to use Femto OS. Built the reference board and implemented an I2C driver for Femto OS for the design. </li>
			
			<li><a href="files/Internship1.pdf"> Design and implementation of a programmer for TI CC2530  </a> :
			As Part of Internship at IIT Delhi, Learnt the basics related to using linux and open source tools to do projects in embedded systems. As a minor task to show case the knowledge I had to develop a microcontroller based programmer for the SoC TI CC2530. I Developed the embedded hardware and software for the programmer based on a given design. Also patched the Linux OS application for the programmer to provide it the ability to recognize and program the SoC. </li>
