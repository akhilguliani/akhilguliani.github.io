      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed as part of a team a proof of concept for device file virtualization for Palacios Virtual Machine Monitor. The concept allows a Linux guest to access the device files of the Linux host. Our implenattion was pulled into the main repository available publically at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://v3vee.org/palacios/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=palacios.git;a=commit;h=de0aa03dbd9812a48cab6d899ab41b7f2cc593b5&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. This project started as part of a course and was developed further during an independent study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Determining the Impact of Hashtags used in Marketing Campaigns on Social Media Platforms Using Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://akhilguliani.github.io/project/sentiment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hashtags have become a common way of aggregating a group of social media users around a common topic. Most social media sites have incorporated this feature and it is now starting to be used by marketing agencies as way to engage with its audience and gauge their response to their campaigns. In this project I develop a ranking system based on quantitatively (like the number of people using a particular hashtag, etc.) and qualitatively (Using sentiment analysis to classify the userâ€™s engagement as a positive or a negative, and associate an emotional response to it) analyzing data gathered social media outlets (primarily twitter). I hope that this method is able to provide a consistent view of the engagement level of users towards a product based on the hashtags associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Report on Internship at IIT Delhi in summer 2011. I studied Real Time operating systems (RTOS) and surveyed the possible RTOS options available for a TinyAVR microcontrollers. Chose to use Femto OS. Built the reference board and implemented an I2C driver for Femto OS for the design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Part of Internship at IIT Delhi, Learnt the basics related to using linux and open source tools to do projects in embedded systems. As a minor task to show case the knowledge I had to develop a microcontroller based programmer for the SoC TI CC2530. I Developed the embedded hardware and software for the programmer based on a given design. Also patched the Linux OS application for the programmer to provide it the ability to recognize and program the SoC.&lt;/p&gt;
